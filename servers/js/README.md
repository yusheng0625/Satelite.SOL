# Servers contract JS bindings

**== Work In Progress ==**

Helper functions to access Satellite Servers contract on Solana.

In your own JS project use dependencies from `package.json` and include the code from the `client` folder.

Check out `examples` folder for usage examples.

File `test_wallet.json` contains private key for the test wallet on devnet with some SOL to use by examples. If it runs low on balance just run:

```
solana airdrop 10 tstUd94ZufobTsshi5wiKZ2sZujHt9FwC5LGgJwHuqk
```

And it will airdrop 10 SOL to the test wallet address.
